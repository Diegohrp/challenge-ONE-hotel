## About the project

This project is a desktop application with Data Base connection. It's a hotel management system to make and manage reservations, developed as part of a challenge from the Oracle Next Education program.

I developed the App GUI from scratch using JavaFx and CSS for styling.
## Features

**Login**

When the app starts, a login view is shown requesting administrador credentials such as username and password. These credentials are hardcoded in the database and the passwored is stored as a hash and not in plain text.

**Make a reservation**

To make a reservation, some data is required such as check-in and checkout and payment method.

The total price for the reservation is calculated based on the number of days from check-in to check-out and a daily rate.


**Register guest**

After making a reservation, the register view is shown so the data related to the guest is requested.

**Search guests and reservations**

You can see a table of guests and reservations and search between them by guest's last name or reservation number respectively.

## Demo

### Login

- To login to the app credentials are required.
- The system validates the introduced credentials are in the data base.

### Make a reservation

- The system asks for check-in and check-out dates.
- Check-in must be before check-out and both must be after the current date.
- The total price is calculated based on the days between both dates and a daily rate.
- There are four payment options to choose using a combo box.
- After making a reservation the reservation number is shown.

- The system asks for confirmation to cancel the operation or to return to reservation.

### Search guest

- A table of guests is shown and the administrator can edit the guest's information from there or delete the selected register.
- The fields are validated like phone number format or birthdate.
- To look for a guest, the administrator has to introduce the complete or partially guest's last name and a table with the results is displayed.

### Search reservation

- A table with all the reservations in the system is shown and the administrator can edit or delete a selected register.
- Check-in and check-out dates are validated before the update is send to the database.
- A new total price is calculated when the dates are changed.
- To look for a reservation, the administrator provides the reservation number and a result with the same number or results with a similar number are displayed.
